# Detailed Plan
Create a browser based pokemon game designed around the safari zone minigame. Implement all base game functionalities alongside persistent data storage using MySQL, account creation, account and session security, and data fetching from the PokeAPI.

## Key Features
### Player Account Features
- Register a new account
- Login to existing account
- Users can delete own account

### Admin Features
- Login to existing account
- Delete any non-admin account
- View all pokemon in a user’s inventory
- Create, edit, or delete pokemon in other user’s accounts
    - Edit stat values of pokemon in inventories
- View all areas
- Create, edit, or delete areas
    - Add pokemon to existing or new areas with catch rates
    - Update catch rates of existing pokemon in areas

### Game Features
- Players can view their PC Box which contains all of the pokemon they have caught
    - Players are able to view details about pokemon in their inventory
- Players can choose from many different areas to go to
- Each area houses different pokemon to encounter
- Players are able to leave areas or search for pokemon
- Players can trigger encounters by searching for pokemon in areas
- Encounters select a random pokemon from the list of available pokemon in the area and allow players a chance to catch them by performing different available actions
    - The Throw Bait action reduces pokemon catch rate but lowers their chance to flee
    - The Throw Mud action increases pokemon catch rate but increases their chance to flee
    - The Throw Pokeball action attempts to catch the pokemon using the current catch rate
    - The Run Away action ends the encounter without catching the pokemon and returns the player to the area option screen
